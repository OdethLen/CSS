<h1> Problems </h1>
<h2> by Mother Mother </h2>

<pre>

You and me, we're not the same
I am a sinner, you are a saint
When we get to the pearly gates
You'll get the green light
I'll get the old door in the face

Doo-doo-doo
I'm a loser, a disgrace
Yeah!
I've found love in the strangest place
Tied up and branded, locked in a cage
I say I'm gonna stage a great escape
Let loose and love all pent up and painfully out of place

Doo-doo-doo
I'm a loser, a disgrace
You're a beauty, a luminary, in my face
