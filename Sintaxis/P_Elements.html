<p> Percy Jackson Book I</p>
<p>My	name	is	Percy	Jackson.
I’m	twelve	years	old.	Until	a	few	months	ago,	I	was	a	boarding	student	at
Yancy	Academy,	a	private	school	for	troubled	kids	in	upstate	New	York.
Am	I	a	troubled	kid?
Yeah.	You	could	say	that.
</p>

<p>
I could	start	at	any	point	in	my	short	miserable	life	to	prove	it,	but	things
really	started	going	bad	last	May,	when	our	sixth-grade	class	took	a	field	trip	to
Manhattan	–	twenty-eight	mental-case	kids	and	two	teachers	on	a	yellow	school
bus,	heading	to	the	Metropolitan	Museum	of	Art	to	look	at	ancient	Greek	and
Roman	stuff.
