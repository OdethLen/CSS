<h1>7. My Dinner Goes Up in Smoke</h1>

<p> Word of	the	bathroom	incident	spread	immediately.	Wherever	I	went,	campers
pointed	at	me	and	murmured	something	about	toilet	water.	Or	maybe	they	were
just	staring	at	Annabeth,	who	was	still	pretty	much	dripping	wet.</p>
<p id="para1"> She	showed	me	a	few	more	places:	the	metal	shop	(where	kids	were	forging
their	own	swords),</p>
<p>the	arts-and-crafts	room	(where	satyrs	were	sandblasting	a
giant	marble	statue	of	a	goat-man),	and	the	climbing	wall,	which	actually
consisted	of	two	facing	walls	that	shook	violently,	dropped	boulders,	sprayed
lava	and	clashed	together	if	you	didn’t	get	to	the	top	fast	enough</p>
